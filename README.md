<!-- # PCH AgileUI twitter<sup>®</sup> take home project 

The following is a small test for the PCH UI group to be able to see your skills and see how you code, what standards you use, the clarity of your code, how up to date you are on current UI developments in the industry.
PCH twitter module

*	Use the twitter api to display the last 8 tweets referencing @pchdotcom
*	There have been changes to the twitter API  please use the [pch_twitter_response.json](https://git.prod.pch.com/agileui/interviews/twitter/blob/master/pch_twitter_response.json) file in lieu of this.
*	Use web fonts instead of graphics for display text, find something as close as you can, does not have to be exact.
*	You can use any mix of html/css/js you like.
*	Use vanilla JS, ES6 would be best and SASS if you like.
*	Must work in IE11+, latest 3 versions of FF, Safari 10+, latest 3 versions of Chrome
*	Code must be able to be dropped into a page without clashing with existing code
*	Come as close to the provided design as possible but does not have to be pixel perfect
*	Try to use as few images as possible
*	Try to use any performance enhancements you know of


## Extra Credit
1. "Refresh Tweets" link will refresh with the newest 8 tweets on click with no page refresh if there is no click refresh the tweets with new tweets every 10 seconds, without a page refresh.
2. Don’t use any images (excluding the users twitter avatar and the PCH Logo).
3. Make this module responsive for multiple screen sizes, example: show less tweets for a phone, use a gesture event on touch devices, etc.
4. Make this module using OOP methodology so multiple modules can co-exist on one page with their data encapsulated.
5. If assets are missing try to have your solution degrade gracefully

Please make sure that the code you provide back to us is packaged into a zip file, organize your code however you see fit, also remember this is a chance to show us what cool new tech you know so show off a little, we can't get a good feel for your skills looking at 5 lines of jQuery code
